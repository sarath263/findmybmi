        <h2>BMI and Different Body Types</h2>
        <p>BMI may not be a perfect measure for everyone. Learn about its limitations and how it applies to different body types.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mesomorphs:</strong> Individuals with a naturally muscular physique may have a higher BMI due to muscle mass, but this does not necessarily indicate poor health.</li>
            <li><strong>Endomorphs:</strong> People with a higher body fat percentage might have a higher BMI. Itâ€™s important to consider other health markers alongside BMI.</li>
            <li><strong>Ectomorphs:</strong> Those with a slender build and lower body fat might have a low BMI, but they can still be at risk for certain health issues if they have insufficient muscle mass or poor diet.</li>
            <li><strong>Athletic Builds:</strong> Athletes often have higher BMIs because muscle weighs more than fat. Athletic individuals should consider other measurements like body fat percentage.</li>
            <li><strong>Aging Population:</strong> As people age, they tend to lose muscle and gain fat, which can alter BMI readings. BMI should be interpreted with caution in older adults.</li>
            <li><strong>Children and Adolescents:</strong> BMI for children and teens takes age and sex into account. Growth patterns should be considered when assessing BMI in younger individuals.</li>
